## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

The only thing i've learned with this project was how to hide the default arrow buttons on number inputs. Other than that it was good to test myself.

### Continued development

I only code for fun as of right now, but I would like to focus on improving my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Useful resources

- [w3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_hide_arrow_number.asp) - This site helped me figure out how to hide the default number input buttons. I used this site many times when I first started coding and it's very helpful.
